# emacs.d

lookyhooky's emacs configuration. I've pulled a lot of inspiration from
others on github. Its build on a module system that makes sense to me.
All minor and major mode modules are loaded through `foundation.el`.
Making it easy to load or unload different modules while debugging problems.
